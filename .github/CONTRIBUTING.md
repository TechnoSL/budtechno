# Contributing
Please note that contributions or pull requests (PRs) to budhud should be reserved for fixing bugs/issues with the display of the HUD. This can include things like overlapping elements, incorrect colors, broken animations, and so on. Contributions aimed at adding new features or reworking parts of the HUD are not encouraged through PRs.

While I appreciate suggestions for improvements, I prefer these to be posted in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/PTWkt3h) or in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/rbjaxter/budhud/issues) so that I can decide if and how to implement them. HUDs are inherently subjective and personal for most developers, and it would be unfortunate for someone to do a lot of work only to have their PR rejected.

## Formatting
If you do have a contribution you're making in a PR, please make sure you're following the same format budhud uses. Mainly, this is using spaces for indentations & indenting Values to the 69th column (nice).

## Questions
For any questions, please feel free to message me in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/PTWkt3h) or drop an issue in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/rbjaxter/budhud/issues).
